      It is the first installment in the Avatar film series. It is set in the
      mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable
      moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine
      the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony
      threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid
      species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a
      genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely
      located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]
